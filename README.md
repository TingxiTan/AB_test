*author: Tingxi Tan*

This is a draft of my submission for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In this project we were given the task of helping companies analyze and determine whether they should run new pages, keep old pages, or make longer trials before making decisions by simulating this A/B test.


## Dataset  
ab_data.csv: the table of users' information and their hopping situation  
countries.csv: the table of users' id and their country
